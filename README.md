# Elwin continues to play with Python!

## Make a name_generator module with two methods

### dragon_name
- [ ] takes a person's first name and month of birth
- [ ] returns their dragon name (you decide how this is formed!)

penguin_name
- [ ] takes a person's first name and month of birth
- [ ] returns their penguin name (you decide how this is formed!)
- [ ] Make an app.py file that runs a game loop

User is asked for their name and month of birth
User is asked if they want their dragon name or penguin name
User is shown their new name!
User stays in game until they decide to leave
User can type in exit at any time to exit the program
